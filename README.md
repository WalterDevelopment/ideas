# Ideas
Welcome to [Walter Development](https://github.com/WalterDevelopment)'s ideas!

## *How this will work*
There will be **_one_** file per idea.  For example, **_ideas/youtubesite.md_** is the _'**youtubesite**'_ idea, and so on.
Each idea will contain these things:
- Info about what the idea is.
- **_If there is a repo_**,
  - Current Progress on the idea *(might be automated)*.
  - The **_`#`_** Heading of the file will be a link to the repo.
  - *__(not confirmed)__* A story of issues and their status (solved or open).
- **_If it doesn't have a repo_**,
  - **Resources about the requirements for the project _(for example, the youtubesite project would need Next.js, and if it was a repo, that info would be moved to the repo.)_**
  - **How to setup the project**
  - Any extra information that you think is important.

## Current list of Ideas:
[automation][auto] - Will automate this section and other things. More information at the _.md_ file.
